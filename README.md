<h1>reCAPTCHA library for .NET</h1>

Forked, and amended so that the HTML helper useSsl property is always respected.  I'll revert to Tanveer Yousuf's solution if this gets resolved. 

reCAPTCHA for .NET is one of the most popular and well-documented reCAPTCHA libraries used by thousands of .NET developers in their ASP.NET web forms and MVC applications. The library is created and maintained by <a href="http://twitter.com/tanveery">Tanveer Yousuf</a>.
